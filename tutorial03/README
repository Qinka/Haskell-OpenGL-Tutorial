HNGL is an acronym, standing for HNGL is Not a Graphics Library

It is a set of modules, meant to provide basic geometric shapes rendering.
Currently only squares and circles drawing is supported.

I try keeping files as clean and logical as possible.  If you enjoy early
prototypes and wish to contribute - you are most welcome.
