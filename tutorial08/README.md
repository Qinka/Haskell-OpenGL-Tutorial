Work in Progress :: It's not finieshed yet!

User Interaction

Where we use [reactive-banana](https://github.com/HeinrichApfelmus/reactive-banana) as a FRP library and a brilliant [reactive-banana-glfw](https://github.com/cdxr/reactive-banana-glfw) as a glue for interacting with the program.
The scale of the shape will be controlled by events, corresponding to key-presses.

Future work: Next we'll combine it with animation.
