Starting with Tutorial03, the direction changes towards NGL, 
using the foundation, layed by tutorials 00-02

NGL is an acronym, standing for NGL is Not a Graphics Library

It is a set of modules, meant to provide basic geometric shapes rendering.
At the stage of tutorial03 basic Shapes drawing support is introduced: triangles,
rectangles, circles and polylines.

Future work:  animation support, texturing support, extended input.
